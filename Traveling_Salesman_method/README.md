# Branch and Bound for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
This script implements the Branch and Bound algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

#### Description

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the original city. This script utilizes the Branch and Bound algorithm to efficiently explore all possible permutations of city routes and find the optimal solution.

This codes location starts from Tampere and returns to Tampere. 
Locations given are: 
- Toijala
- Vesilahti
- Sastamala

I have found the shortest possible path to complete the round-trip route using the algorithm. (Travelling salesman problem)
